* ~~and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them~~
* ~~WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation~~
* ~~THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section~~
* ~~WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work~~
* ~~THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's * applications~~
